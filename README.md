## Preface:

 I am determined to become an **Embedded systems engineer**.

 *[Our destination is the sea of stars.]*

### -What is the reason for joining bilibili and GitHub?

 As the foreword says, I am determined to become an Embedded systems engineer, and coming to bilibili is a way to learn. To tell you the truth, I have visited bilibil for more than **1 years**. Recently, I decided to be an up (uploader) and share with you the **open source projects** I have made and learn from them. By joining GitHub, I can easily share open source projects.

### -About me:

 At present, I am in the third year of junior high school. Before that, I have hardly won any formal awards related to scientific and technological invention activities ~~(but I don't mean I don't have that strength)~~. I love embedded design, The legend of Zelda.Now I focus on in-depth study of **digital circuit, analog circuit, single chip microcomputer (ESP series and Atmega series at present) and various CAD softwares**.

 But I also made a **rectifier filter board**, which is a double-layer PCB. 11V AC input, 5V and 12V output, Maximum Power **40W**.



 I'm not very good at this kind of formal communication, but I'm also easy to get along with.

 I have established my account name as "**荒野四季SOTW**", GitHub nicknamed **SoTWild**, representing **Seasons Of The Wild**.

------

### -Set up the account:

 When you see this article, my account **should have been established**. In the next few days, I will publish news and videos from time to time, and upload open source materials（ The update frequency may be **low**, but the quality will be **high**).

### -About open source:

#### **Open source here includes source code and hardware resources. The purpose of open source is to share and learn from each other（ Default GPL protocol)**

 In every "**open source documents**", I will carefully sort out the documents, and include a **markdown** format file like this article (article format, file format), including Chinese and English translation (there are also PDF, mainly for people who don't have suitable software to open **[software is Typora]**), to ensure that everyone can understand and successfully copy the project.

 *[To put it bluntly, it's a nanny level course]*

## Epilogue:

 I hope I can learn more in the future, waiting for me (and my team).
